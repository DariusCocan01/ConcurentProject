and it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
then the piper will lead us to reason
and a new day will dawn for those who stand long
and the forests will echo with laughter

and it makes me wonder
if there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
it's just a spring clean for the may queen
yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
there's still time to change the road you're on
