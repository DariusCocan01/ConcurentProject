your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
the piper's calling you to join him
dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

and as we wind on down the road
our shadows taller than our soul
there walks a lady we all know
who shines white light and wants to show
how everything still turns to gold

and if you listen very hard
the tune will come to you at last
when all is one and one is all, that's what it is
to be a rock and not to roll, oh yeah
and she's buying a stairway to heaven
