there's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
and she's buying a stairway to heaven
when she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
with a word she can get what she came for
ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven

there's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
in a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

there's a feeling i get when i look to the west
and my spirit is crying for leaving
in my thoughts i have seen rings of smoke through the trees
and the voices of those who stand looking
